We said goodbye to the year 2017 quite a while ago, so now it is time once again to see what 
that year's worth of data had to tell us. As I did last year, I unleashed [Pandas][pandas] and 
[Matplotlib][matplotlib] on 2017 data from the database that powers XonStat:
[XonStatDB][xonstatdb]. Let's see what it has to tell us!

Let's first look at the number of games throughout the year:

  <img src="/m/uploads/2018/01/2017_games_per_month.png" title="2017 Games Per Month" class="thumb m10">
</a>

The number of games for the first part of the year - through July - is lower than the year
before, in most cases only by a little. What's interesting is that the rest of the year has higher
numbers! Unfortunately they weren't enough to make up the huge two months we had in January and
February last year, so the overall amount of games through the year is down by just over 19K. The
discrepancy might be explained by the heightened interest in the game through all of the practice
sessions, YouTube videos, and player interviews for the Xonotic World Cup that was going on at 
the time. Perhaps it is time to do another one of those!

Next let's check the most popular time to find games:

</a>

Once again 8PM UTC takes the cake for the most popular time to play. This corresponds to the
evening time for EU residents, so it appears that they enjoy de-stressing by fragging. As far
as days go, Friday is unsurprisingly the best one. Everyone is getting their weekends started
right!

The next chart shows the number of distinct players per month.

  <img src="/m/uploads/2018/01/2017_players_per_month.png" title="2017 Players Per Month" class="thumb m10">
</a>

As with the number of games, the number of players is down for the first half of the year compared
with 2016. However, unlike the number of games measure the overall number of distinct players for 2017 is much higher! 
Approximately 3K more players played in 2017. It follows
that the bigger the pool of players that we have available to play in games, the more games we'll end up
having, so let's do our best to welcome these new players into our community so we can have an
awesome 2018.

Next let's have a look at weapons: 

<a href="/m/uploads/2018/01/2017_weapon_damage_per_month.png">
  <img src="/m/uploads/2018/01/2017_weapon_damage_per_month.png" title="2017 Weapon Damage Per Month" class="thumb m10">
</a>

We can't extrapolate a ton of information from this chart given that it contains data from
all game modes and all configurations, but it is useful to get a high level view of what weapons
players are using. On that front it is good to see that each weapon has a place or "band" on the
vertical bars, which indicates that all of them are being used. We'd have a concern if any
of the "core" weapons were only represented with tiny slivers.

As a fun side note to this chart, please be aware that the blaster metrics are excluded. When I
ran the numbers this time I saw some truly whacky numbers for that weapon that I've yet to explain.
I'll defer that explanation to another time so I can do some analysis! It's likely that some server
was misconfigured. Who knows - someone could have hosted a week long blaster-only tournament. The
jury is still out on this one.

Moving on to the frags dealt by all of those weapons:

<a href="/m/uploads/2018/01/2017_weapon_frags_per_month.png">
  <img src="/m/uploads/2018/01/2017_weapon_frags_per_month.png" title="2017 Weapon Frags Per Month" class="thumb m10">
</a>

This one also has representation from each of the weapons in the game, which is good to see! One point to
note is that the devastator almost always leads in frags versus, say, the vortex. A common
complaint is that the vortex is overpowered (op), but the data both on damage and frags indicates
otherwise, at least in the general sense. More digging into different modes may yield different
conclusions.

That's it for this year's data exploration. As mentioned before, I've placed the code
that generated these charts on [Github][repo] if you're the coding type. If you're not, I hope 
to see you out on the servers instead - let's get out there and do our best to bump up
the 2018 numbers!
